After a year of service through Navient and reaching the 10-year mark, in the spring of XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for loan forgiveness using their online form. It was only when I received a denial of forgiveness letter telling me that I was ineligible that I learned I was consolidated under the wrong program. I had never been told that I had to have my loans consolidated with the Federal Student Loan program. The consolidation under the correct program is now complete, though that has been problematic because I have had conversations with both the StudentLoans.gov office and Navient, with differing responses about what my new payments will be ( although, at least I was given a forbearance while the loans were processed ). However, the one consistency has been that my 10 years of payments have mattered not, that I will have to pay for another 10 years before I am eligible for forgiveness. Because I am not able to make a dent in the principle, my student loan balance is now over {$120000.00}.\n",
